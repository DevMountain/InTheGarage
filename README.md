An iOS app that demonstrates building an app with Core Data from scratch.

Create a CarController with addCar, removeCar, and a cars property with overwritten getter method

Create a CoreDataHelper that returns your managedObjectContext from the AppDeleget and gives you a save method

You need a detail view controller that saves the current car, and updates with the last car saved into Core Data
